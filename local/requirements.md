🛠️ Description of the project

This is an MCP server that queries RIPEStat service and presents information to AI assistant using MCP protocol.

🛠️ Workflow you MUST follow

1.Analyse & Plan

- If the feature requirement is to implement a external endpoint, fetch the data first to discover structure and make sure that implementation aligns with reality
- Summarise the business goal and acceptance criteria in ≤ 6 bullet points.
- List affected packages / binaries.
- Write a short design decision (if obvious) or note “Design open” and stop.

2.Implement

- Assure that implementation does not leave any signs that have been implemented by LLM or AI.
- Use a new branch named feat/<ticket-or-short-slug> or sprint-<sprint number> if it is a part sprint.
- Align implementation style with the rest of the project for consistency.
- Write idiomatic, well-commented Go 1.24+.
- Write unit tests so overall project coverage is >90% and internal packages are covered in 100% and are passing
- Write e2e tests and assure that those are passiing
- Run golangci-lint to assure that is is passing
- Update docs (comments, README.md).
