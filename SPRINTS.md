# Sprints

Each entry in the table below corresponds to a specific feature implementation,
its associated development branch, the target release version, and usually the
RIPEstat API endpoint(s) it utilizes.

Sprints are executed in non-continuous fashion. In example, Sprint 99 might be
implemented before Sprint 9 - depending on the needs of the project.

> [!NOTE]
> Add-hoc updates that are not part of a sprint are not listed here. Those are
> usually related to bug fixes or documentation updates, but could be also
> related to a specific life improvement in development.
